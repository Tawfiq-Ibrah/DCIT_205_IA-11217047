 HOW TO CLONE AND SET-UP PROJECT


1. Install Git: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you don't have git installed, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. Copy the Repository URL: Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to clone. Click on the green "Code" button. Then click the clipboard icon to copy the URL.

3. Clone the Repository: Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal app on macOS, or any terminal emulator on Linux). Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` command. Then run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone <URL>
    ```
    Replace `<URL>` with the URL of the repository you copied earlier. This will create a new directory with the same name as the repository, and clone the repository into that directory.

4. Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate into the project directory. For example, if your repository name is `my-project`, you would use:
    ```bash
    cd my-project
    ```
5. Install Dependencies (if applicable): If the project has dependencies, you'll need to install them. If the project uses npm (Node.js), you can use the following command to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    If the project uses another package manager (like pip for Python or Maven for Java), you'll need to use the appropriate command for that package manager.

6. Run the Project (if applicable): If the project is an application, you can run it. The command to run the project depends on the language and framework the project uses. For a Node.js application, the command is usually:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Check the project's README file for specific instructions.

Remember, these are general instructions and might not apply exactly to all projects. Always check the project's README file for specific setup instructions.
